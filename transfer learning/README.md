# Cat vs Dog Classification with VGG16

This project involves training an image classification model to differentiate between cats and dogs using the VGG16 architecture. The approach includes both feature extraction and fine-tuning of the VGG16 model to achieve high accuracy in classification.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and train an image classification model capable of distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. The VGG16 model, known for its deep architecture and performance, is utilized for this purpose. The project demonstrates the application of both feature extraction and fine-tuning techniques to improve model performance.
